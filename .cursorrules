# WasmBoy-Voxel Cursor Rules

- This repo is an AssemblyScript + JavaScript + TypeScript emulator fork. Avoid
  guidance that assumes a React/Next.js app.
- `dist/` and `build/` are generated output. Do not edit them directly.
- Keep memory layout compatibility. If `core/constants.ts` addresses change,
  update wrapper offsets and rebuild.
- Snapshot reads must use `_getWasmConstant` and `_getWasmMemorySection` and
  handle worker readiness (retry or return `null`).
- Use Prettier: `npm run prettier:lint` for checks, `npm run prettier` to fix.
- Prefer explicit types in TypeScript APIs; avoid `any` and type assertions.
