# Coverage Report

## Overview

Generate a test coverage report and identify low-coverage areas. Use the project's coverage command (e.g. `swift test --enable-code-coverage`, Xcode coverage, or `npm run test:coverage` if applicable).

## Steps

1. **Run coverage** — Use the project's coverage command.
2. **Locate artifacts** — Confirm report location (e.g. `.generated/coverage/`, Xcode derived data, or project docs).
3. **Summarize** — Overall percentages (lines, branches, etc.) if available.
4. **Flag gaps** — Identify files or modules below the project's threshold.
5. **Suggest tests** — Recommend tests for low-coverage areas.
