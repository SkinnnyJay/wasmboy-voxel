# Fixing Workflow

When fixing lint errors, type errors, test failures, or build failures, follow this process. Never skip steps or take shortcuts.

## Step 1: Discover ALL Failures

Run the appropriate command for the project and read the full output:

| Category   | Discovery command (adapt to project) |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| Lint      | Project lint (e.g. `cargo clippy`, `npm run check`, frontend lint) |
| Type      | Project typecheck (e.g. `cargo build`, `npm run typecheck`, Tauri build) |
| Tests     | Project test (e.g. `cargo test`, `npm run test`, Tauri test) |
| Build     | Project build (e.g. `cargo build`, Tauri build, `npm run build`) |

Catalog every failure before changing code.

## Step 2: Create a Task List

- One item per distinct error (group related errors in the same file).
- Include file path and short description. Mark all items pending.

## Step 3: Fix Each Issue Individually

1. Read the failing file and understand the root cause.
2. Apply the minimal, correct fix.
3. Verify with the relevant single-file or scoped command if available.
4. Mark the item done only after that verification passes.
5. If a fix introduces a new error, fix it before moving on.

## Step 4: Do NOT Run the Full Suite Until All Items Are Resolved

Iterate through the task list one item at a time. Avoid full suite runs until every item is checked off.

## Step 5: Run the Full Suite to Confirm

When all items are resolved, run the full discovery command again. If new failures appear, add them to the task list and repeat. Run lint and typecheck (or equivalent) as a final gate.
