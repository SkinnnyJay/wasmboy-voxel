# Code Quality Standards

## AssemblyScript (core/)

- Explicit types; avoid `any` and unsafe casts.
- Prefer small, focused functions; avoid large allocations in hot paths.
- Keep memory layout changes coordinated with `core/constants.ts` and wrapper offsets.
- Only meaningful comments (why, non-obvious logic). No emoji in code or comments.

## JavaScript/TypeScript (lib/, voxel wrapper)

- Explicit types for public APIs; avoid `any` and type assertions (`as`).
- Prefer early returns and small helpers; keep functions under ~500 lines,
  files under ~2500 lines.
- Use named constants instead of magic numbers, except for hardware addresses
  that are documented and grouped.
- Avoid `console.*` in library code unless strictly required.

## General

- Do not edit generated output in `dist/` or `build/`.
- Keep naming consistent: camelCase for functions/variables, PascalCase for types/classes.
