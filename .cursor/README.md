Configuration for Cursor AI (rules, agents, commands) when working in this
repository.

## Project: WasmBoy-Voxel

**What we're building:** A WasmBoy fork with PPU snapshot APIs used by
`gameboy-remix` for voxel rendering. AssemblyScript core, JS wrapper + workers,
and a TypeScript voxel wrapper.

**Canonical docs:** `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md` at repo root.

## Contents

- **rules/** — code-style, fixing-workflow, and API patterns for the snapshot API.
- **agents/** — Code reviewer, debugger, researcher, verifier, test-runner, security-reviewer.
- **commands/** — Build, test, lint, typecheck, commit, coverage, review (WasmBoy-Voxel scripts).
